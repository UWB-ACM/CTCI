## Problems

<a name="p1"/>

### Skills Check (5 Minutes)

How would you explain recursion to a 5-year-old?

#### Interviewer Notes

Did the interviewee:

- [ ] Demonstrate a foundational understanding of recursive processes?
- [ ] Show creativity with analogies?
- [ ] Explain their analogy clearly using language appropriate for the scenario?
- [ ] Confirm with you that you understood their approach, and clarify as needed?

### Behavioral Question (5-10 Minutes)

Tell me about a project you've worked on that you are most excited about.

#### Interviewer Notes

Follow-up questions to ask:

* Was this an individual project or did you collaborate with others?
* What kind of data structures and algorithms did you use to build this project?
* What other skills did you use in this project?
* What excites you most about this project in particular?

Did the interviewee:

- [ ] Clearly demonstrate excitement about the project?
- [ ] Provide adequate context about the project's goals and challenges?
- [ ] Demonstrate thorough technical understanding of this project?
- [ ] Impress you with the project itself?

### Technical Question (30+ Minutes)

#### Scenario

You have a tree where each node connection has a "stickiness" value. 
The "stickiness" value indicates how much time it would take for water 
to drip from the parent node to the child node.

Write a function that computes the amount of time it would take for 
the entire tree to be covered in water if water is dumped on the root 
node at `t = 0`.

#### Interviewer Notes

- How would you represent the edge weights? There are multiple ways to do this.
- Don't assume this is a binary tree.
- How would you generalize this solution for a directed graph?

Did the candidate:

- [ ] Draw out simple examples?
- [ ] Create basic definitions for the classes/structs for `Node` and/or `Edge`?
- [ ] Write a recursive function to find the maximum sum of the paths from root to leaf?
- [ ] Trace through their solution code using a simple example?
- [ ] Address errors they found in their solution?
