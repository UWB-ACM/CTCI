## Problems

<a name="p1"/>

### Skills Check (5 Minutes)

What is the difference between a queue and a priority queue?

Source: Lizzy

#### Interviewer Notes

Did the candidate:

- [ ] Demonstrate a foundational understanding of queues? Use the term 'FIFO'?
- [ ] Address ordering mechanisms for priority queues?
- [ ] Discuss common applications of either data structure?
- [ ] Discuss time complexity differences between the two?
- [ ] Explain their thinking clearly?
- [ ] Draw examples?

### Behavioral Question (5-10 Minutes)

Tell me about a time you were working on a project and you disagreed 
with a colleague. What was the outcome?

#### Interviewer Notes

Follow-up questions to ask:

* Why did you choose to approach the situation in that particular way?
* What would you do differently next time you face a similar scenario?

Did the candidate:

- [ ] Provide context for why there was a disagreement?
- [ ] Explain how the issue was resolved?
- [ ] Demonstrate compromise and collaboration in their answer?
- [ ] Convince you that you would want them on your team in scenarios like this?

### Technical Question (30+ Minutes)

Source: CTCI 16.11

#### Scenario

You are building a diving board by placing a bunch of planks of wood 
end-to-end. There are two types of planks, one of length `shorter` and 
one of length `longer`. You must use exactly `K` planks of wood. Write 
a function to generate all possible lengths for the diving board.

#### Interviewer Notes

Hints:

* Consider building a diving board. What are the choices you make?
* Consider a recursive solution.
* Once you have a recursive algorithm, think about the runtime. Can you make this faster? How?
* Consider memoization to optimize the runtime. Think carefully about what exactly you cache. What is the runtime? The runtime is closely related to the max size of the table.
* There's an alternate, clever (and very fast) solution. You can actually do this in linear time without recursion. How?

Did the candidate:

- [ ] Draw out simple examples?
- [ ] Ask clarifying questions about what `shorter` and `longer` are? (Once the candidate asks, you can tell them `shorter` and `longer` are integer arguments, as is `k`.)
- [ ] Consider possible duplicate lengths in a recursive solution, and handle this appropriately?
- [ ] Write a recursive solution?
- [ ] Optimize their recursive solution?
- [ ] Write the optimal solution?

_Note: if time allows, guide the candidate to find all possible solutions (recursive and iterative)._
