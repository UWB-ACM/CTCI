# Mock Interviews

A mock interview session hosted by UWB ACM for the final Cracking 
the Coding Interview workshop of Fall 2019.

### Format

Workshop attendees have tackled difficult problems covering a variety 
of topics; now, they shall test their technical and communication skills 
in pairs with brand-new problems.

The problem sets will be given in the following format:

* One skills check question
* One behavioral interview question
* One technical interview question

Each person will have about 45 minutes to tackle all three questions. 
Ideally, the skills check & behavioral question will take about 10-15 
minutes, and the remaining time will be spent on the technical question.

The person asking the questions will have the solution sheet and hints 
for the technical question, and the problem set will include space for 
note-taking and a short checklist of traits to look for in the 
interviewee's answer/approach.
