### 2. PROBLEM 2 TODO :bug:

Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-a-multilevel-doubly-linked-list/

#### Scenario

You are given a doubly linked list which in addition to the next and previous pointers, it could have a child pointer, which may or may not point to a separate doubly linked list. These child lists may have one or more children of their own, and so on, to produce a multilevel data structure, as shown in the example below.

Flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list. You are given the head of the first level of the list.


#### Example Input

Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8,9,10,null,null,11,12]
Output: [1,2,3,7,8,11,12,9,10,4,5,6]
Explanation:

The multilevel linked list in the input is as follows:\n
 1---2---3---4---5---6---NULL\n
         |
         7---8---9---10---NULL\n
             |
             11--12---null\n


After flattening the multilevel linked list it becomes:
1---2---3---7---8---11---12---9---10---4---5---6---NULL

Example 2:

Input: head = [1,2,null,3]
Output: [1,3,2]
Explanation:

The input multilevel linked list is as follows:

  1---2---NULL
  |
  3---NULL
  
Example 3:

Input: head = []
Output: []

#### Function Signature

public Node flatten(Node head)
