## Background

When employers are hiring for technical roles, they look for candidates 
who possess the skills and experience that would make that candidate an 
asset to the team.

Technical skills are certainly an important trait that makes a candidate 
a good fit for a software engineering role. However, even more so, an 
engineer will need to **collaborate and communicate effectively** so that 
the team environment is positive and productive. 

This requirement necessitates behavioral interviews to fully assess 
candidates for a role, even a role as an individual contributor (as 
opposed to a manager of products, projects, or people).

## How to Prepare for Behavioral Interviews

As we just saw, behavioral interviews, just like technical interviews, are 
an essential element of interviewing for technical roles, and unlike 
technical interviews, **they are easy to prepare for**.

It just takes a little bit of thought on your part.

Here are a few actions we recommend you take when preparing for an interview 
loop.

<a name="research"/>

### 1. Research the Employer

Many companies conduct behavioral interviews because they are looking for 
a **cultural fit** between you and their teams.

Typically, the traits they are looking for align with the company's 
**core values**. As a candidate, you should look for the same thing! 
Understanding the company's external and internal values helps reinforce 
your interest in the company and your excitement for the position.

To understand the company's values, motivations, and cultural fit, **read 
the company's website**, looking specifically at the careers pages, "About 
the Company" pages, and customer relations pages.

Here are a few examples of well-advertised company values pages:

* [Digital Ocean's core values](https://www.digitalocean.com/about); scroll down
* [Amazon's Leadership Principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles)
* [Microsoft's corporate values](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles)
* [Google's mission statement](https://about.google/) and [customer commitments](https://about.google/commitments/)

You can also utilize Glassdoor, LinkedIn, and other career-specific sites 
to better understand the experiences of the company's current employees.

### 2. Prepare Talking Points About Yourself

Now that you know a bit about the company, it's time to think about how 
you can make yourself shine in the eyes of the company.

Here are some questions to think about:

* What kind of projects bring you joy?
* What are your technical and professional goals?
* How do you facilitate collaboration? How do you address its inherent challenges?
* What's a project or position that you're particularly proud of? What about this work makes you happy?
* How do you give back to the community? Why are these activities important to you?
* Why do you want to work for this particular company?
* How does your previous work reflect the company's values?

For all of these traits, **write down specific examples**. If the're in 
your resume, even better! When employers ask behavioral interviews, they 
generally look for **specific instances** where you demonstrated these 
traits in action. In other words, they want to know _that you can walk 
the walk and live by your own values_.

Ideally, your resume showcases your best personal traits and explicitly or 
implicitly communicates these ideas. If that is not the case, consider 
restructuring or revising your resume so that your best, most authentic 
self is reflected in your skills and experience.

**Not sure where to start?** Consider building a **mind map** of all your 
skills, talents, experiences, and interests. (Make Laurie proud!)

### 3. Build a Question Bank

**Look for behavioral interview questions online.** Plenty of general 
and company-specific lists are available online.

Most questions can be grouped into two categories:

* Positive traits (illustrating creativity, leadership, teamwork, and problem-solving)
* Pressure-oriented traits (response to stressors, failures, and conflict)

Here are some sites to get you started:

* [Inc.com list of stress-oriented questions and ideas about well-formulated answers](https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/9-most-common-behavioral-interview-questions-and-a.html)
* [Behavioral questions for developers, grouped by assessed trait](https://devskiller.com/45-behavioral-questions-to-use-during-non-technical-interview-with-developers/)
* [A short list of good questions from Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/blog/11-must-ask-behavioral-interview-questions/)

Also check out LeetCode, Glassdoor, LinkedIn, developer blogs, Cracking 
the Coding Interview, Cracking the PM Interview, and other sites for ideas. 
Leverage your network to source questions, especially if those questions 
are being asked in interviews at your dream company.

Look specifically for questions that **you don't feel ready to answer**. 
If you read a questions and it's something that you immediately want to 
talk about, you will likely feel much more prepared for that topic in 
a real interview. You can (and should) prepare these questions beforehand, 
but it would be wise to spend more time focusing on questions that make 
you feel nervous or stumped.

### 4. The STAR Method

Now that you have some ideas about what you might be asked, it's time 
to think about how you would express your answer.

In almost every instance, it is expected that you answer the question by 
drawing upon previous experiences that are relevant. This is an **event-oriented** 
approach and aligns with the **show, don't tell** principle of effective 
storytelling.

A tried-and-true answer format is called **STAR**. It stands for:

* **Situation**: give background for the example you are using to address the question
* **Task**: describe the problem you faced and its challenges
* **Action**: explain what you did to solve the problem and how you did it
* **Response**: state the benefits, impacts, and rewards of your actions

Practice formulating STAR responses based on questions in your question 
bank. The more you try it, the easier it becomes to think of specific 
examples and communicate your contributions.

### 5. Organize Some Mock Interviews

As with technical interviews, behavioral interviews are easy to practice! 

Consider organizing some **mock interviews** with trusted friends, 
project collaborators, and classmates. Reach out to your network to 
pair up with people who are currently in industry, or find new connections 
to do mock interviews or informational interviews about their employers.

### 6. Prepare Your Own Questions

Just as you are being evaluated at an interview, you should use the 
opportunity to evaluate the company you're interviewing with. Prepare 
questions you have about the company's culture, expectations, office 
environment, work-life balance, or anything else you want to know 
about.

Doing this, and asking the questions in the interview when time allows, 
shows the interviewer that you are enthusiastic about the company, 
curious, intelligent, and engaged in your conversation with them.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

* How have your job responsibilities changed or grown since you started working here?
* How do teams make decisions about their products? What level of autonomy do teams have over design & implementation decisions?
* How has the company nurtured your professional growth? What kind of educational and professional development opportunities are available?
* Why did you decide to join this company? This team?
* What does a typical week look like for your team? Day? Month? Quarter?
* What processes does your organization have in place to help new engineers ramp up quickly?
* What processes are in place to help team members who are struggling?
* Does your team eat lunch together or socialize outside of work?
