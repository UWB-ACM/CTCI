### 1. Lonely on Twitter :bird:

Source: Lizzy

#### Scenario

On Twitter, users can follow other users, but the other users do not have 
to follow the initiator back. In this problem, we want to find the 
loneliest Twitter user -- the account with the highest number of 
followed accounts who did not follow back.

You are given a collection of users, and each user has a collection of accounts 
they are following. This data structure represents the directed graph of a Twitter network. 
Find the user with the highest number of unreciprocated follows.

#### Example Input

Here's a simple example:

```
Input:
    - Mindy: [Mork]
    - Mork: [Mindy]
    - Orson: [Mork, Mindy]
Output: Orson
```

Orson follows both other users, but neither of them follow him. Orson 
is the loneliest user.

```
Input:
    - Peter: [Lois, Chris, Brian]
    - Lois: [Chris, Brian, Stewie]
    - Brian: [Stewie, Lois]
    - Meg: [Peter, Lois, Chris, Brian, Stewie]
    - Chris: [Peter, Lois, Brian]
    - Stewie: []
Output: Meg
```

Meg has followed 5 users, but none of them have reciprocated; she is by far the loneliest user.
