### 1. Lonely on Twitter :bird:

Source: Lizzy

#### Scenario

On Twitter, users can follow other users, but the other users do not have 
to follow the initiator back. In this problem, we want to find the 
loneliest Twitter user -- the account with the highest number of 
followed accounts who did not follow back.

You are given a collection of users, and each user has a collection of accounts 
they are following. This data structure represents the directed graph of a Twitter network. 
Find the user with the highest number of unreciprocated follows.

#### Example Input

Here's a simple example:

```
Input:
    - Mindy: [Mork]
    - Mork: [Mindy]
    - Orson: [Mork, Mindy]
Output: Orson
```

Orson follows both other users, but neither of them follow him. Orson 
is the loneliest user.

```
Input:
    - Peter: [Lois, Chris, Brian]
    - Lois: [Chris, Brian, Stewie]
    - Brian: [Stewie, Lois]
    - Meg: [Peter, Lois, Chris, Brian, Stewie]
    - Chris: [Peter, Lois, Brian]
    - Stewie: []
Output: Meg
```

Meg has followed 5 users, but none of them have reciprocated; she is by far the loneliest user.

### 3. Power Stations

Source: Mitchell

#### Scenario

The electrical system of HappyLand consists of ``N`` stations from ``0`` to ``N-1`` including ``M`` power plants where electricity is produced and the rest ``N-M`` stations are used for transmitting electricity, ``M <= N``. After a hurricane, HappyLandâ€™s authorities need to shut down ``K`` station(s) for maintenance. For safety reasons, a shutdown station has no electricity coming in/out of it. To be considered active, a station, unless it is a power plant which can power itself and stations receiving electricity from it, must receive electricity from at least one active station. Otherwise, it is also shut down indirectly. **Find out all stations that are shutdown by disconnecting K stations.**

Each station is represented by a vertex. Directed arrows indicate the electrical dependency between stations (receive from or transfer to its neighboring stations). Each station is guaranteed to be powered by at least one power plant.

![Electrical system](./PowerStations/Figure12.png)

#### Example Input
```
N =6; M=2; K=1;
PowPlants[M] = {0,5};
Maint[N] = {0};
Matrix[N][N] = {{0,1,0,1,0,0},
              {0,0,1,0,1,0},
              {0,0,0,0,0,0},
              {0,0,0,0,1,0},
              {0,0,1,0,0,0},
              {0,0,0,0,1,0}};
```
#### Example Output
Offline stations:
```
0 1 3
```
<details>
<summary>Click to see explanation</summary>

##### Explanation:
There are 6 stations. 2 power plants are 0 and 5. Station 0 is shut down for maintenance.

Shutting down station 0 shuts down station 1 and 3 as they only receive electricity from power plant 1. Stations 2 is powered by active station 4, which is powered by active power plant 5, also active.

#### Function Signature
C++:

```c++
// Definition of Graph
struct Graph {
    explicit Graph() = default;
    int N,M,K;
    vector<vector<bool> > Matrix;
    vector<int> PowPlants;
    vector<int> Maint;
};

void Solve(Graph &G) {
    // your code goes here

}
```
Java:

```Java
// Definition of Graph
static class Graph {
    public Graph() { }
    public int N,M,K;
    public int Matrix[][];
    public int PowPlants[];
    public int Maint[];
}
public static void Solve(Graph G) {
    // your code goes here

}

```

### 1. Lonely on Twitter :bird:

Source: Lizzy

#### Solution

We want to track how much lower the reciprocation of each follow 
is for each user. So, we inspect each user, and one by one, we 
inspect that user's followed list. We lookup that followed account 
and see if the user is in the followed account's set; if it is, 
the follow is reciprocated. If it is not, we subtract 1 from the 
differential.

<details>
<summary>See Python3 solution</summary>

```python3
def lonely(users: dict) -> str:
    # users is a dictionary with K:V of str:set
    if not users: return None

    # create differential
    diff = {}
    for user in users:
        diff[user] = 0
        for followed in users[user]:
            if user not in users[followed]: 
                diff[user] -= 1

    # transform differential data into a list of pairs
    result = [(user, count) for user, count in diff.items()]
    # sort list of pairs by differential, lowest to highest
    result.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
    return result[0][0]
```

</details>

What is wrong with this solution, if anything?

<details>
<summary>What's wrong</summary>

1. This solution doesn't account for multiple users having the same 
   follower differential, and only takes the first available answer.
2. The manipulation of the differential data is not particularly 
   efficient in runtime, although the code is concise and readable. 
   The list comprehension has a time complexity of `O(N^2)` because 
   lists with appended items are rebuilt in each iteration. The sort 
   call has an optimal time complexity of `O(n log n)`.

### 3. Power Stations

Instead of validating the status of current vertex by checking vertices(stations) it relies on, we could approach the problem top-down: we assume that all stations are shut down. Starting with known power plant that remains active, we activate adjacent stations and substations of the current active station using DFS.Stations that are not activated by the end of the algorithm are the ones affected by shutting down K stations.

###### Pseudocode
```
void Solve() {
  -> mark all stations as Offline
  -> mark power plants that are in maintenance as Offline
  // start marking from active power plants i-th
  for (i : M) {
    if (PowPlants[i] is active)
      DFS(PowPlants[i]);
  }
}
void DFS(int Cur) {
  if (Cur is in maintenance) return; // stop checking

  // Otherwise mark Cur as active and visited
  Visited[Cur] = true;
  Active[Cur] = true;

  // check its adjacent
  for (i : N) {
    // if i is not visited and has path from Cur->i
    if (!Visited[i] && Matrix[Cur][i])
      DFS(i);
  }
}
```

###### Time complexity:

- Best and average case: when M is significantly small to N, it is ``O(M*N)``.
- Worst case: when M is close to N or M==N, the algorithm has the same complexity as that of DFS which is ``O(N^2)``.
