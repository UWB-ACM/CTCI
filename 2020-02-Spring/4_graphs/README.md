### 2. PROBLEM 2


#### Scenario

The electrical system of HappyLand consists of ``N`` stations from ``0`` to ``N-1`` including ``M`` power plants where electricity is produced and the rest ``N-M`` stations are transmission substations, ``M <= N``. After a hurricane, HappyLandâ€™s authorities need to turn off some stations for maintenance. For safety reasons, an offline station has no electricity coming in/out of it. Consequently, substations rely only on offline stations are disconnected from the grid. Power plants can power themselves and adjacent stations. **Find out which stations are shutdown by disconnecting K stations.**

Each station is represented by a vertex. Directed arrows indicates the electrical dependency between stations (receive from or transfer to its neighboring stations). Each substation is powered by at least one power plant.

#### Example Input
```
N =6; M=2; K=1;
PowPlants[M] = {0,5};
Maint[N] = {0};
Matrix[N][N] = {{0,1,0,1,0,0},
              {0,0,1,0,1,0},
              {0,0,0,0,0,0},
              {0,0,0,0,1,0},
              {0,0,1,0,0,0},
              {0,0,0,0,1,0}};
```
#### Example Output
Offline stations:
```
0 1 3
```
##### Explain:
There are 6 stations. 2 stations (0 and 5) are power plants. 1 station(0) is in maintenance.

Shutting down station 0 results its dependents (station 1 and 3) disconnected from the grid. No electricity comes in and out of 0, 1, and 3. Stations 2 and 4 remain on as the power plant 5 is active.
Figure 1 visualizes the electricity grid of a country.

### 2. SOLUTION 2

Instead of validating the status of current vertex by checking vertices(stations) it relies on, we could approach the problem top-down: we assume that all stations are shut down. Starting with known power plant thats remain active, we activate adjacent stations and substations of the current active station using DFS.Stations that are not activated by the end of the algorithm are the ones affected by shutting down K stations.

###### Pseudocode
```
void Solve() {
  -> mark all stations as Offline
  -> mark power plants that are in maintenance as Offline
  // start marking from active power plants i-th
  for (i : M) {
    if (PowPlants[i] is active)
      DFS(PowPlants[i]);
  }
}
void DFS(int Cur) {
  if (Cur is in maintenance) return; // stop checking

  // Otherwise mark Cur as active and visited
  Visited[Cur] = true;
  Active[Cur] = true;

  // check its adjacent
  for (i : N) {
    // if i is not visited and has path from Cur->i
    if (!Visited[i] && Matrix[Cur][i])
      DFS(i);
  }
}

###### Complexity:

- Best and average case: when M is significantly small to N, it is ``O(M*N)``.
- Worst case: when M is close to N or M==N, the algorithm has the sam complexity as that of dfs which is ``O(N^2)``.
