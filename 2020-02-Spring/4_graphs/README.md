### 3. Power Stations

#### Scenario

The electrical system of HappyLand consists of ``N`` stations from ``0`` to ``N-1`` including ``M`` power plants where electricity is produced and the rest ``N-M`` stations are used for transmitting electricity, ``M <= N``. After a hurricane, HappyLandâ€™s authorities need to shut down ``K`` station(s) for maintenance. For safety reasons, a shutdown station has no electricity coming in/out of it. To be considered active, a station, unless it is a power plant which can power itself and stations receiving electricity from it, must receive electricity from at least one active station. Otherwise, it is also shut down indirectly. **Find out all stations that are shutdown by disconnecting K stations.**

Each station is represented by a vertex. Directed arrows indicate the electrical dependency between stations (receive from or transfer to its neighboring stations). Each station is guaranteed to be powered by at least one power plant.

#### Example Input
```
N =6; M=2; K=1;
PowPlants[M] = {0,5};
Maint[N] = {0};
Matrix[N][N] = {{0,1,0,1,0,0},
              {0,0,1,0,1,0},
              {0,0,0,0,0,0},
              {0,0,0,0,1,0},
              {0,0,1,0,0,0},
              {0,0,0,0,1,0}};
```
#### Example Output
Offline stations:
```
0 1 3
```
<details>
<summary>Click to see explanation</summary>

##### Explanation:
There are 6 stations. 2 power plants are 0 and 5. Station 0 is shut down for maintenance.

Shutting down station 0 shuts down station 1 and 3 as they only receive electricity from power plant 1. Stations 2 is powered by active station 4, which is powered by active power plant 5, also active.

### 3. Power Stations

Instead of validating the status of current vertex by checking vertices(stations) it relies on, we could approach the problem top-down: we assume that all stations are shut down. Starting with known power plant that remains active, we activate adjacent stations and substations of the current active station using DFS.Stations that are not activated by the end of the algorithm are the ones affected by shutting down K stations.

###### Pseudocode
```
void Solve() {
  -> mark all stations as Offline
  -> mark power plants that are in maintenance as Offline
  // start marking from active power plants i-th
  for (i : M) {
    if (PowPlants[i] is active)
      DFS(PowPlants[i]);
  }
}
void DFS(int Cur) {
  if (Cur is in maintenance) return; // stop checking

  // Otherwise mark Cur as active and visited
  Visited[Cur] = true;
  Active[Cur] = true;

  // check its adjacent
  for (i : N) {
    // if i is not visited and has path from Cur->i
    if (!Visited[i] && Matrix[Cur][i])
      DFS(i);
  }
}

###### Time complexity:

- Best and average case: when M is significantly small to N, it is ``O(M*N)``.
- Worst case: when M is close to N or M==N, the algorithm has the same complexity as that of DFS which is ``O(N^2)``.
