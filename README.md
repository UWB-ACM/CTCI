## About the Workshop

Every quarter, UWB ACM hosts a 6-8 week workshop series covering common 
technical topics and programming paradigms that are of special interest 
to future employers. The workshop is formatted to give students an opportunity 
to practice problem-solving techniques in a low-stress, low-risk environment 
prior to encountering similar problems in stressful interview settings. 

In particular, the workshop focuses on solving programming problems and 
communicating thought processes to participants' peers. It is lead by 
current UW Bothell students.

If you need intensive, concept-specific practice, the following resources 
are excellent. Each of them includes an extensive question bank organized 
by concept, accompanied by complete solutions.

These resources include solutions for the given problems; some are 
published and provably correct and others are sourced from community 
contributors.

### Mock Interview Resources

If you're looking for forums to practice interviewing and communication skills, 
these resources are a good place to start. 

* Fellow students, friends, alumni, and LinkedIn connections. Reach out and ask 
    if these people would be willing to give you some time to do a mock interview. 
    The worst answer you can get is "no".
* [PraMP](https://www.pramp.com/): free for 6 sessions[\*\*](#footnotes)
* [interviewing.io](https://interviewing.io): free[\*\*](#footnotes)
* [UWB-ACM](https://uwbacm.com/): annual Mock Interview event, free for all attendees. Check the club's event calendar for upcoming dates.
