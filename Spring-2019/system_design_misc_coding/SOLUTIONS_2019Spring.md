# Miscellaneous Coding & System Design

Problems and solutions for Miscellaneous Coding & System Design session on May 17, 2019.

## Background

The goal of this session is to get attendees to think about large-scale 
engineering problems that you might encounter in the real world. If your 
manager asked you to implement an entire project, how would you go about 
doing so? How would you design it?

These questions are common in real-world interviews, including interviews 
with major technology firms (i.e. FAANG). 

Some key tips from the CTCI chapter on the subject (Chap. 9):

- **Communicate your ideas clearly.** You are in charge of how this 
  system gets implemented; show your interviewer that you are thinking 
  about what the system would require to function as desired.
- **Use the whiteboard.** Draw pictures and diagrams. Make lists of 
  questions, ideas, and potential difficulties. This will help your 
  interviewer _see_ your though process, quite literally.
- **Keep the design broad.** Do not get bogged down with minute details 
  at the beginning of your design. If the system is a house, it needs 
  a solid foundation before it needs framing, drywall, or decorations.
- **Make reasonable assumptions, and listen to your interviewer.** When 
  working on a problem, you have to make assumptions about data availability, 
  technology stacks, user traffic, system memory, and many other things. 
  Start with assumptions that seem reasonable. If your interviewer is 
  looking for specific use cases, listen to them carefully and consider 
  how you might incorporate them.
- **Do your best.** There is no such thing as a perfect system, and no 
  reasonable person would expect you to design one in an interview. Work 
  hard to communicate your ideas and flesh out an idea based on your 
  existing knowledge.

For more specific information about designing systems to be scalable, 
limiting factors in system design, and the problem-solving process, 
we recommend reading the Cracking the Coding Interview chapter on the 
subject.
