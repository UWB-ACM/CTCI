## Problems

### 1. Flight Reservations

Source: Tom Blanchard

#### Scenario

A plane has 300 seats; 50 first class seats, 50 comfort seats and 200 economy seats.
The airline must have a way for customers to reserve their seats. How would you design a system for 
keeping track of customers reserving seats, managing confirmations, and making sure that 
seats on the plane are not over booked. Create a UML class diagram illustrating the 
relationship between any classes you would need to represent this reservation system.
