## Problems

### 1. Two Sum

Source: [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) 

#### Scenario

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

#### Example Input

Example:

```
Input:   arr = [2, 7, 11, 15]     target = 9
Output:  [0, 1] because arr[0] + arr[1] = 2 + 7 = 9
```

#### Function Signature

Java:

```java
int[] twoSum(int[] arr, int target) {}
```

C++:

```c++
vector<int> twoSum(vector<int> arr, int target);
```

### 2. Rotate Matrix

Source: CTCI 1.7

#### Scenario

You are given an `n x n` 2D matrix representing an image. Rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

#### Example Input

Example:

```
[ [1,2,3],        output     [ [7,4,1],
  [4,5,6],        ----->       [8,5,2],
  [7,8,9] ]                    [9,6,3] ]
```

#### Function Signature

Java:

```java
void rotateMatrix(int[][] mtx) {}
```

C++:

```c++
void rotateMatrix(vector<vector<int>> mtx);
```
